This is a study repository of the NodeJs tool. 
It has text files, and comments on the code, explaining its concepts and how it works.
And a project utilizing NodeJs and MongoDB.

The project currently utilizes Nodemon for the server resets.
EJS as the template view.
Express as the Framework for the routers.
Lodash just for experimentation.
Mongoose to interact with the Mongodb.
Morgan for some Middlewares.

It is a study repository, so it has a lot of commented code showing the different ways to make something, at first with raw NodeJs, afterward with all the facilities above.

"npm install" is recommended for the dependencies.
