It is possible to run JavaScript on the Browser because of the V8 Engine that runs on it.
The V8 Engine takes the JavaScript code and compile down to Machine code (NodeJs is written in C++).
With NodeJs we can run JavaScript code in computer or server.

-------------------------
The Role of Node.Js
The Client-Server Architecture.

The Node server is running JavaScript on the Back-End to deal with the requests made by the Client.

A Bonus for using node is that we can utilize the same code from Front-End on the Back-End and vice versa.
